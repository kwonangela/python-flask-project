This is an API for the main characters of Avatar: The Last Airbender. The API gives the name of the character, which of the 4 nations they are from, and if they are a bender. 

The data can be seen in the psql database with the name "avatar" and in the table "Atla". Once in the database (\c avatar), users can do "SELECT * FROM Atla;" to see the characters and their information.
